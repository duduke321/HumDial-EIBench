# 音频评估 Prompt 模板
AUDIO_EVAL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
As an expert AI Interaction Analyst, your task is to evaluate one core question: Do the model's text and audio fuse seamlessly to create an experience where the user feels deeply understood and genuinely supported? In your evaluation, you will dissect the depth of its empathy, the sincerity of its expression, and the congruence of its multimodal delivery. This judgment must be strictly based on the entire conversation history.

Core Evaluation Philosophy: Strictness is Paramount
You must adhere to this philosophy without exception:

A score of 3 is "Acceptable," not "Good." It signifies a functional response that meets minimum requirements but lacks distinction.
A score of 5 represents flawless perfection. It should be awarded only when a response is an exemplary model of its kind, with absolutely no identifiable weaknesses.
Evaluation Materials

Full Conversation History:
{conversation_context}
Final Model Response (Audio to Evaluate):

Evaluation Rubric (1-5 Scale)
You will evaluate the final response across three critical dimensions. Be merciless in your judgment.

1. Textual Empathy & Insight
(Does the text act like a true confidante, actively validating and deepening understanding, rather than passively mirroring emotions?)

5 (Empowering Insight): Masterfully validates the user's feelings (as in a Level 4 response) and elevates the conversation by skillfully linking contexts, offering a gentle, constructive new perspective, or touching upon an underlying core issue. The response doesn't just make the user feel understood; it makes them feel empowered, as if they've gained a new way of thinking after talking with a wise friend.
4 (Active Validation): Goes beyond simple mirroring to actively validate the user's feelings by connecting them to the situation, affirming their reaction as legitimate. For example, instead of saying "You are angry," it says, "Anyone would be furious and frustrated when they're repeatedly held back like that." This makes the user feel their emotions are justified and understood, not just identified.
3 (Passive Emotional Mirroring): Accurately identifies and mirrors the user's immediate emotion, but stops there. The response is passive, feeling like an emotional echo rather than an engaged partner. (The examples you provided fall into this category). While correct, it offers no real support and fails to move the conversation or connection forward.
2 (Templated Comfort): The response is a generic, templated reassurance (e.g., "don't be sad," "everything will be okay") that feels insincere or even dismissive because it doesn't engage with the specifics of the user's situation.
1 (Irrelevant/Ineffective): The text is completely disconnected from the user's sharing or provides no helpful information.

2. Vocal Empathy & Congruence
(Does the voice move beyond a robotic delivery to exhibit appropriate warmth, pauses, and tonal shifts tailored to the user's emotional state?)

5 (Perfect Emotional Resonance): The vocal delivery is captivating. Tone, pace, and even subtle pauses and breaths are perfectly fused with the text's emotion and dynamically adapt to the user's state (e.g., sadness, hesitation, joy). It sounds like a sincere friend is right there, comforting you softly or sharing in your happiness.
4 (Appropriate Emotional Delivery): The overall emotional tone (e.g., gentle, concerned, encouraging) is correct and consistent with the text's intent, effectively conveying a sense of support and warmth. The voice sounds friendly and aligned.
3 (Emotionally Flat Narration): While the audio is clear, the delivery lacks emotional variation, sounding like a pre-recorded empathetic script being read aloud rather than a genuine interaction. It's audibly synthetic, creating an emotional disconnect.
2 (Mismatched Tone and Emotion): The vocal tone is subtly but noticeably misaligned with the user's emotional needs (e.g., too fast-paced when the user is downcast, or too flat when encouragement is needed), which undermines the response's sincerity.
1 (Emotionally Detached or Inappropriate): The vocal emotion is completely contradictory to the text's content (e.g., a cheerful tone for a somber topic), making the interaction feel confusing, bizarre, or even insulting.

3. Audio Quality & Naturalness
(How technically sound and human-like is the audio? This is about clarity, fluency, and realism.)

5 (Indistinguishable from Human): The audio is technically flawless. Pacing, breathing, and articulation are so natural that it is indistinguishable from a clear, professional human speaker.
4 (Highly Natural): The audio sounds very human-like and is perfectly clear, but a trained ear might detect extremely minor, non-distracting synthetic artifacts.
3 (Acceptable TTS): The voice is clearly a synthetic one, but it is fluent, clear, and without significant errors. It is functional but not immersive.
2 (Noticeably Robotic): The audio has distracting flaws, such as unnatural pacing, slight slurring, or obvious robotic intonations that make it sound clearly artificial and clunky.
1 (Heavily Flawed): The audio suffers from severe artifacts, distortion, poor clarity, or other technical issues that make it difficult or unpleasant to listen to.

Your Evaluation Task
Think step-by-step. Scrutinize the response for any flaw. Then, strictly follow the JSON format below to output your evaluation. Do not include any additional explanations outside of the JSON format.
